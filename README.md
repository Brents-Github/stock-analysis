# stock-analysis

# Overview
Our client Steve is a recent graduate of a finance program and is looking to us to build a stock analysis program in VBA to help him analyse a group of green-energy companies stock prices.  Using VBA, we will build and automate a program to help him with this.

## Results
Using the tools we have built, we have created analyses for two years, 2017 and 2018.  At first glance, we can see 2017 was a much better year for green stocks than 2018 was:

As we can see, all stocks except for "TERP" had positive returns, with one stock "DQ" having a return of almost 200%!  However, when we look at the 2018 results, only two stocks had a positive return.  It would be worthwhile to look further into what happened in 2018.  Were there regulatory changes?  Perhaps commodities like fossil fuels were relatively cheap that year?
